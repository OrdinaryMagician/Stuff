Random single-file programs I've written in my spare time for small tasks.

* bleep: I got bored and decided to write a pc speaker music program.
* ckmextract: Extracts ESP and BSA from Skyrim steam workshop mod archives.
* ddsinfo: Shows contents of a DDS header.
* dood: Reads an ENDOOM lump and mirrors every word "down the middle".
* fmod\_playbank (formerly fuck\_fmod): Tool for playback of .fsb files.
* fuzz: A fancy blocky noise filter using proto-AliceGL designs.
* glfuzz: OpenGL version of the filter.
* lutconv: A program for converting various "3D" LUT textures to actual 3D LUTs
  in DDS volume maps. Successor to mkvolume. Used for MariENB.
* memrd/memsk/memwr: Quick 'n dirty tools for memory manipulation on running
  programs.
* mkfont: A tool I use to convert UE fonts exported with UTPT into fonts for
  GZDoom.
* mkgauss: Make an array of gaussian blur kernel values with passed radius and
  sigma. Used for shader development.
* mksoundwad: Program used during the early days of Tim Allen Doom. Deprecated
  as notsanae now also replaces sounds through an OpenAL hook.
* mkssao: Make an array of SSAO samples. Also for shader development.
* mkvolume: Old program for making LUT volume maps.
* mkwall: A program I use on a daily basis to set my wallpaper on every Linux
  machine.
* osnorm: Experiment for generating object-space normals from an .obj model.
* pframes: Short utility for automating long FrameIndex lists for MODELDEF.
* schange: Program used along with mkwall to update the wallpaper on screen
  geometry changes.
* skse_cosave: Experiment for dumping information in SKSE co-saves.
* soapstone: Random soapstone messages from all 3 dark souls games. Messages
  can be generated in bulk.
* totty: Sends text from stdin to tty1. Used to send certain commands when
  remoting into a Raspberry Pi.
* udmfvis: dmvis clone in C for UDMF maps. No external dependencies.
* umxunpack: Extractor for music in UE archives, with support for Unreal 227's
  UMX files containing vorbis audio.
* vc2sdl: Passes the contents of the VC4 framebuffer to a SDL window. Was used
  for video playback experiments on a Raspberry Pi with a SPI LCD.
* withhands: Talk like W.D. Gaster.
* zfs-rootfs.patch: The original patch for archzfs to support my specific
  rootfs dataset mountpoint quirks.
* zimagekver: Quick program to extract version info from an ARM Linux kernel
  image.
